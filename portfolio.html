    <br> The name of our game is called Racing Minions. In this game, you race against a CPU aka “The Evil Minion” and you need to cross the finish line first in order to win. The game is designed in a way that you first choose a one of the three minions given, then you race against the CPU for 3 laps. If you win, the minion you chose will appear on the win screen. However, if you lose, the Evil Minion will appear on the lose screen. Once you start the code, you will have to choose one of the three minions given. After that, a countdown will start and soon enough you will start racing against the CPU for 3 laps. To control your car, you use the arrow keys (right key to move right, up key to accelerate, left key to move left, etc.). If you finish first, then you are presented with a Win screen with some positive music with you chosen minion. However, if you lose, you are presented with a Lose screen with some negative music with the evil minion.
