    <br>   Build your own bear! It adds a little bit more love to life. Our invention is exactly like the ones in real life, but better. Add some style  with your bearâ€™s necklace, hat, and phone. Make your bear any color with any accessory, with endless combinations! Once you start the code, you are presented with a series of questions within VS code. This series of questions include yes/no and color-based questions to help you personalize your bear. Depending on your answers to these questions, the code will execute a specific response to apply it on the bear.
