    <br>   The name of our game is called Minion Stacker. This game includes a timer for how long you have till the round is over. The game is designed to get points based on how many minions you stack before the round is finished. Some minions like the purple ones can get you more points sense they are more rare than the other ones.  You are only able to move left and right but not up and down. Once you start the code, The timer starts as well. Minions slowly but surely fall from the sky. The minions are randomized and the randomizer only includes the purple minion one out of 10 minions. Once you see a Minion then you are able to move them by using the A and D ( left and right). Once you are able to move the minions you can start placing them on eachother. Keep in mind that the timer is short so you have to have the skills to be able to score high.
